To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).\n\n\u003e ### Use ld-find-code-refs\n\u003e\n\u003e LaunchDarkly provides the [ld-find-code-refs utility](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-find-code-refs) that creates repository connections, generates code reference data, and creates calls to the code references API. Most customers do not need to call this API directly.\n\nThe code references API provides access to all resources related to each connected repository, and associated feature flag code reference data for all branches.

	gen_ContextsResourceCmd := NewResourceCmd(
		rootCmd,
		analyticsTrackerFn,
		"contexts",
		"\nContexts are people, services, machines, or other resources that encounter feature flags in your product. Contexts are identified by their `kind`, which describes the type of resources encountering flags, and by their `key`. Each unique combination of one or more contexts that have encountered a feature flag in your product is called a context instance.\n\nWhen you use the LaunchDarkly SDK to evaluate a flag, you provide a context to that call. LaunchDarkly records the key and attributes of each context instance. You can view these in the LaunchDarkly user interface from the **Contexts** list, or use the Context APIs. To learn more, read [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).\n\nLaunchDarkly provides APIs for you to:\n\n* retrieve contexts, context instances, and context attribute names and values\n* search for contexts or context instances\n* delete context instances\n* fetch context kinds\n* create and update context kinds\n\nTo learn more about context kinds, read [Context kinds](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts/context-kinds).\n\nContexts are always scoped within a project and an environment. Each environment has its own set of context instance records.\n\nSeveral of the endpoints in the contexts API require a context instance ID or application ID. Both of these IDs are returned as part of the [Search for context instances](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContextInstances) response. The context instance ID is the `id` field of each element in the `items` array. The application ID is the `applicationId` field of each element in the `items` array. By default, the application ID is set to the SDK you are using. In the LaunchDarkly UI, the application ID and application version appear on the context details page in the \"From source\" field. You can change the application ID as part of your SDK configuration. To learn more, read [Application metadata configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/app-config).\n\n### Filtering contexts and context instances\n\nWhen you [search for contexts](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContexts) or [context instances](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContextInstances), you can filter on certain fields using the `filter` parameter either as a query parameter or as a request body parameter.\n\nThe `filter` parameter supports the following operators: `after`, `anyOf`, `before`, `contains`, `equals`, `exists`, `notEquals`, `startsWith`.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eExpand for details on operators and syntax\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n#### after\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field, which should be dates, are after the provided time. For example:\n\n* `myField after \"2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00\"`\n\n#### anyOf\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field match any of the values in the match value. For example:\n\n* `myField anyOf [44]`\n* `myField anyOf [\"phone\",\"tablet\"]`\n* `myField anyOf [true]\"`\n\n#### before\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field, which should be dates, are before the provided time. For example:\n\n* `myField before \"2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00\"`\n\n#### contains\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if all the match values are found in the list of values in this field. For example:\n\n* `myListField contains 44`\n* `myListField contains [\"phone\",\"tablet\"]`\n* `myListField contains true`\n\n#### equals\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if there is an exact match on the entire field. For example:\n\n* `myField equals 44`\n* `myField equals \"device\"`\n* `myField equals true`\n* `myField equals [1,2,3,4]`\n* `myField equals [\"hello\",\"goodbye\"]`\n\n#### exists\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if the field matches the specified existence. For example:\n\n* `myField exists true`\n* `myField exists false`\n* `*.name exists true`\n\n#### notEquals\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if there is not an exact match on the entire field. For example:\n\n* `myField notEquals 44`\n* `myField notEquals \"device\"`\n* `myField notEquals true`\n* `myField notEquals [1,2,3,4]`\n* `myField notEquals [\"hello\",\"goodbye\"]`\n\n#### startsWith\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if the value in a field, which should be a singular string, begins with the provided substring. For example:\n\n* `myField startsWith \"do\"`\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nYou can also combine filters in the following ways:\n\n* Use a comma (`,`) as an AND operator\n* Use a vertical bar (`|`) as an OR operator\n* Use parentheses `()` to group filters\n\nFor example:\n\n* `myField notEquals 0, myField notEquals 1` returns contexts or context instances where `myField` is not 0 and is not 1\n* `myFirstField equals \"device\",(mySecondField equals \"iPhone\"|mySecondField equals \"iPad\")` returns contexts or context instances where `myFirstField` is equal to \"device\" and `mySecondField` is equal to either \"iPhone\" or \"iPad\"\n\n#### Supported fields and operators\n\nYou can only filter certain fields in contexts and context instances when using the `filter` parameter. Additionally, you can only filter some fields with certain operators.\n\nWhen you search for [contexts]((/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContexts)), the `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators:\n\n|\u003cdiv style=\"width:120px\"\u003eField\u003c/div\u003e |Description |Supported operators |\n|---|---|---|\n|`applicationId` |An identifier representing the application where the LaunchDarkly SDK is running. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`id` |Unique identifier for the context. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`key` |The context key. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |\n|`kind` |The context kind. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`kinds` |A list of all kinds found in the context. Supply a list of strings to the operator. |`equals`, `anyOf`, `contains` |\n|`kindKey` |The kind and key for the context. They are joined with `:`, for example, `user:user-key-abc123`. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`kindKeys` |A list of all kinds and keys found in the context. The kind and key are joined with `:`, for example, `user:user-key-abc123`. Supply a list of strings to the operator. |`equals`, `anyOf`, `contains` |\n|`q` |A \"fuzzy\" search across context attribute values and the context key. Supply a string or list of strings to the operator.  |`equals` |\n|`name` |The name for the context. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `exists`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |\n|`\u003ca kind\u003e.\u003can attribute name\u003e` |A kind and the name of any attribute that appears in a context of that kind, for example, `user.email`. To filter all kinds, use `*` in place of the kind, for example, `*.email`. You can use either a literal attribute name or a JSON path to specify the attribute. If you use a JSON path, then you must escape the `/` character, using `~1`, and the `~` character, using `~0`. For example, use `user.job/title` or `user./job~1title` to filter the `/job/title` field in a user context kind. If the field or value includes whitespace, it should be enclosed in double quotes. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `exists`, `startsWith`, `before`, `after`.|\n\nWhen searching for [context instances](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContextInstances), the `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators\n\n|\u003cdiv style=\"width:120px\"\u003eField\u003c/div\u003e |Description |Supported operators |\n|---|---|---|\n|`applicationId` |An identifier representing the application where the LaunchDarkly SDK is running. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`id` |Unique identifier for the context instance. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`kinds` |A list of all kinds found in the context instance.

For a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and `false`. Multivariate flags have more variation values, and those values could be any JSON type: numbers, strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting rules, the variations are referred to by their index into this array.\n\nTo update these attributes, read [Update feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag), especially the instructions for **updating flag settings**.\n\n### Per-environment configurations\n\nEach entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object that represents the environment-specific flag configuration data available in the flag's Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags).\n\nTo update per-environment information for a flag, read [Update feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag), especially the instructions for **turning flags on and off** and **working with targeting and variations**.\n\n### Individual context targets\n\nThe `targets` and `contextTargets` arrays in the per-environment configuration data correspond to the individual context targeting on the Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Individual targeting](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/individual-targeting).\n\nEach object in the `targets` and `contextTargets` arrays represents a list of context keys assigned to a particular variation. The `targets` array includes contexts with `contextKind` of \"user\" and the `contextTargets` array includes contexts with context kinds other than \"user.\"\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"environments\" : {\n    \"production\" : {\n      ...\n      \"targets\": [\n        {\n          \"values\": [\"user-key-123abc\"],\n          \"variation\": 0,\n          \"contextKind\": \"user\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"contextTargets\": [\n        {\n          \"values\": [\"org-key-123abc\"],\n          \"variation\": 0,\n          \"contextKind\": \"organization\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `targets` array means that any user context instance with the key `user-key-123abc` receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. The `contextTargets` array means that any organization context with the key `org-key-123abc` receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. Recall that the variations are stored at the top level of the flag JSON in an array, and the per-environment configuration rules point to indexes into this array. If this is a boolean flag, both contexts are receiving the `true` variation.\n\n### Targeting rules\n\nThe `rules` array corresponds to the rules section of the Targeting tab. This is where you can express complex rules on attributes with conditions and operators. For example, you might create a rule that specifies \"roll out the `true` variation to 80% of contexts whose email address ends with `gmail.com`\". To learn more, read [Creating targeting rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/targeting-rules#creating-targeting-rules).\n\n### The fallthrough rule\n\nThe `fallthrough` object is a special rule that contains no conditions. It is the rollout strategy that is applied when none of the individual or custom targeting rules match. In the LaunchDarkly UI, it is called the \"Default rule.\"\n\n### The off variation\n\nThe off variation represents the variation to serve if the feature flag targeting is turned off, meaning the `on` attribute is `false`. For boolean flags, this is usually `false`. For multivariate flags, set the off variation to whatever variation represents the control or baseline behavior for your application. If you don't set the off variation, LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.\n\n### Percentage rollouts\n\nWhen you work with targeting rules and with the default rule, you can specify either a single variation or a percentage rollout. The `weight` attribute defines the percentage rollout for each variation. Weights range from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout). The weights are scaled by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can be represented without using floating-point. For example, a weight of `60000` means that 60% of contexts will receive that variation. The sum of weights across all variations should be 100%.\n",

We recommend using the payload's \"date\" field as a timestamp to reorder webhooks as they are received.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"canonical\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/v2/projects/alexis/environments/test\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"parent\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/v2/auditlog\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/v2/auditlog/57c0a8e29969090743529965\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"site\": {\n      \"href\": \"/settings#/projects\",\n      \"type\": \"text/html\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"_id\": \"57c0a8e29969090743529965\",\n  \"date\": 1472243938774,\n  \"accesses\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateName\",\n      \"resource\": \"proj/alexis:env/test\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"kind\": \"environment\",\n  \"name\": \"Testing\",\n  \"description\": \"- Changed the name from ~~Test~~ to *Testing*\",\n  \"member\": {\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"href\": \"/internal/account/members\",\n        \"type\": \"application/json\"\n      },\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/internal/account/members/548f6741c1efad40031b18ae\",\n        \"type\": \"application/json\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"_id\": \"548f6741c1efad40031b18ae\",\n    \"email\": \"ariel@acme.com\",\n    \"firstName\": \"Ariel\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Flores\"\n  },\n  \"titleVerb\": \"changed the name of\",\n  \"title\": \"[Ariel Flores](mailto:ariel@acme.com) changed the name of [Testing](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)\",\n  \"target\": {\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"canonical\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/v2/projects/alexis/environments/test\",\n        \"type\": \"application/json\"\n      },\n      \"site\": {\n        \"href\": \"/settings#/projects\",\n        \"type\": \"text/html\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"name\": \"Testing\",\n    \"resources\": [\"proj/alexis:env/test\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Signing the webhook\n\nOptionally, you can define a `secret` when you create a webhook. If you define the secret, the webhook `POST` request will include an `X-LD-Signature header`, whose value will contain an HMAC SHA256 hex digest of the webhook payload, using the `secret` as the key.\n\nCompute the signature of the payload using the same shared secret in your code to verify that the webhook was triggered by LaunchDarkly.\n\n## Understanding connection retries\n\nIf LaunchDarkly receives a non-`2xx` response to a webhook `POST`, it will retry the delivery one time. Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If you build an integration on webhooks, make sure it is tolerant of delivery failures.\n",

To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).\n\nWorkflow templates allow you to define a set of workflow stages that you can use as a starting point for new workflows. You can create these workflows for any flag in any environment and any project, and you can create as many workflows as you like from a given template.\n\nYou can create workflow templates in two ways:\n* by specifying the desired stages, using the `stages` property of the request body\n* by specifying an existing workflow to save as a template, using the `workflowId` property of the request body\n\nYou can use templates to create a workflow in any project, environment, or flag. However, when you create a template, you must specify a particular project, environment, and flag. This means that when you create a template using the `stages` property, you must also include `projectKey`, `environmentKey`, and `flagKey` properties in the request body. When you create a template from an existing workflow, it will use the project, environment, and flag of the existing workflow, so those properties can be omitted from the request body.\n\nTo learn more, read [Workflows documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows) and [Workflows API documentation](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/tag/Workflows).\n",

You can also include approval requests at different stages of a workflow. To learn more, read [Workflows](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/feature-workflows/workflows).\n\nThe actions supported are as follows:\n\n- Turning targeting `ON` or `OFF`\n- Setting the default variation\n- Adding targets to a given variation\n- Creating a rule to target by segment\n- Modifying the rollout percentage for rules\n\nYou can create multiple stages of a flag release workflow. Unique stages are defined by their conditions: either approvals and/or scheduled changes.\n\nSeveral of the endpoints in the workflows API require a workflow ID or one or more member IDs. The workflow ID is returned as part of the [Create workflow](/tag/Workflows#operation/postWorkflow) and [Get workflows](/tag/Workflows#operation/getWorkflows) responses. It is the `_id` field, or the `_id` field of each element in the `items` array. The member ID is returned as part of the [List account members](/tag/Account-members#operation/getMembers) response.

For example, setting `filter=query:dark-mode,tags:beta+test` matches flags with the string `dark-mode` in their key or name, ignoring case, which also have the tags `beta` and `test`.\n\nThe `filter` query parameter supports the following arguments:\n\n| Filter argument       | Description | Example              |\n|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| `applicationEvaluated`  | A string. It filters the list to flags that are evaluated in the application with the given key. | `filter=applicationEvaluated:com.launchdarkly.cafe` |\n| `archived`              | (deprecated) A boolean value. It filters the list to archived flags. | Use `filter=state:archived` instead |\n| `contextKindsEvaluated` | A `+`-separated list of context kind keys. It filters the list to flags which have been evaluated in the past 30 days for all of the context kinds in the list. | `filter=contextKindsEvaluated:user+application` |\n| `codeReferences.max`    | An integer value. Use `0` to return flags that do not have code references. | `filter=codeReferences.max:0` |\n| `codeReferences.min`    | An integer value. Use `1` to return flags that do have code references. | `filter=codeReferences.min:1` |\n| `creationDate`          | An object with an optional `before` field whose value is Unix time in milliseconds. It filters the list to flags created before the date. | `filter=creationDate:{\"before\":1690527600000}` |\n| `evaluated`             | An object that contains a key of `after` and a value in Unix time in milliseconds. It filters the list to all flags that have been evaluated since the time you specify, in the environment provided. This filter requires the `filterEnv` filter. | `filter=evaluated:{\"after\":1690527600000},filterEnv:production` |\n| `filterEnv`             | A string with a list of comma-separated keys of valid environments. You must use this field for filters that are environment-specific. If there are multiple environment-specific filters, you only need to include this field once. You can filter for a maximum of three environments. | `filter=evaluated:{\"after\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production,status:active` |\n| `hasExperiment`         | A boolean value. It filters the list to flags that are used in an experiment. | `filter=hasExperiment:true` |\n| `maintainerId`          | A valid member ID. It filters the list to flags that are maintained by this member. | `filter=maintainerId:12ab3c45de678910abc12345` |\n| `maintainerTeamKey`     | A string. It filters the list to flags that are maintained by the team with this key. | `filter=maintainerTeamKey:example-team-key` |\n| `query`                 | A string. It filters the list to flags that include the specified string in their key or name. It is not case sensitive. | `filter=query:example` |\n| `state`                 | A string, either `live`, `deprecated`, or `archived`. It filters the list to flags in this state. | `filter=state:archived` |\n| `sdkAvailability`       | A string, one of `client`, `mobile`, `anyClient`, `server`. Using `client` filters the list to flags whose client-side SDK availability is set to use the client-side ID. Using `mobile` filters to flags set to use the mobile key. Using `anyClient` filters to flags set to use either the client-side ID or the mobile key. Using `server` filters to flags set to use neither, that is, to flags only available in server-side SDKs.  | `filter=sdkAvailability:client` |\n| `tags`                  | A `+`-separated list of tags. It filters the list to flags that have all of the tags in the list. | `filter=tags:beta+test` |\n| `type`                  | A string, either `temporary` or `permanent`. It filters the list to flags with the specified type. | `filter=type:permanent` |\n\nThe documented values for the `filter` query are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:beta+test` must be encoded to `%2B`.\n\nBy default, this endpoint returns all flags. You can page through the list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links will not be present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.\n\n### Sorting flags\n\nYou can sort flags based on the following fields:\n\n- `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the flag.\n- `key` sorts by the key of the flag.\n- `maintainerId` sorts by the flag maintainer.\n- `name` sorts by flag name.\n- `tags` sorts by tags.\n- `targetingModifiedDate` sorts by the date that the flag's targeting rules were last modified in a given environment. It must be used with `env` parameter and it can not be combined with any other sort. If multiple `env` values are provided, it will perform sort using the first one. For example, `sort=-targetingModifiedDate\u0026env=production\u0026env=staging` returns results sorted by `targetingModifiedDate` for the `production` environment.\n- `type` sorts by flag type\n\nAll fields are sorted in ascending order by default. To sort in descending order, prefix the field with a dash ( - ). For example, `sort=-name` sorts the response by flag name in descending order.\n\n### Expanding response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional fields in the response, with the following fields:\n\n- `codeReferences` includes code references for the feature flag\n- `evaluation` includes evaluation information within returned environments, including which context kinds the flag has been evaluated for in the past 30 days\n- `migrationSettings` includes migration settings information within the flag and within returned environments. These settings are only included for migration flags, that is, where `purpose` is `migration`.\n\nFor example, `expand=evaluation` includes the `evaluation` field in the response.\n\n### Migration flags\nFor migration flags, the cohort information is included in the `rules` property of a flag's response, and default cohort information is included in the `fallthrough` property of a flag's response.\nTo learn more, read [Migration Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).\n",

		Short: "Update feature flag",
		Long:  "Perform a partial update to a feature flag. The request body must be a valid semantic patch, JSON patch, or JSON merge patch. To learn more the different formats, read [Updates](/#section/Overview/Updates).\n\n### Using semantic patches on a feature flag\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nThe body of a semantic patch request for updating feature flags takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some instructions only) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object. The body of a single semantic patch can contain many different instructions.\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating feature flags.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand instructions for \u003cstrong\u003eturning flags on and off\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey` parameter.\n\n#### turnFlagOff\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **Off**.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnFlagOn\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **On**.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand instructions for \u003cstrong\u003eworking with targeting and variations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey` parameter.\n\nSeveral of the instructions for working with targeting and variations require flag rule IDs, variation IDs, or clause IDs as parameters. Each of these are returned as part of the [Get feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/getFeatureFlag) response. The flag rule ID is the `_id` field of each element in the `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object. The variation ID is the `_id` field in each element of the `variations` array. The clause ID is the `_id` field of each element of the `clauses` array within the `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object.\n\n#### addClauses\n\nAdds the given clauses to the rule indicated by `ruleId`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauses`: Array of clause objects, with `contextKind` (string), `attribute` (string), `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers, or dates) properties. The `contextKind`, `attribute`, and `values` are case sensitive. The `op` must be lower-case.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n\t\"instructions\": [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addClauses\",\n\t\t\"ruleId\": \"a902ef4a-2faf-4eaf-88e1-ecc356708a29\",\n\t\t\"clauses\": [{\n\t\t\t\"contextKind\": \"user\",\n\t\t\t\"attribute\": \"country\",\n\t\t\t\"op\": \"in\",\n\t\t\t\"negate\": false,\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\"USA\", \"Canada\"]\n\t\t}]\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addPrerequisite\n\nAdds the flag indicated by `key` with variation `variationId` as a prerequisite to the flag in the path parameter.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `key`: Flag key of the prerequisite flag.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation of the prerequisite flag.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n\t\"instructions\": [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addPrerequisite\",\n\t\t\"key\": \"example-prereq-flag-key\",\n\t\t\"variationId\": \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\"\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addRule\n\nAdds a new targeting rule to the flag. The rule may contain `clauses` and serve the variation that `variationId` indicates, or serve a percentage rollout that `rolloutWeights`, `rolloutBucketBy`, and `rolloutContextKind` indicate.\n\nIf you set `beforeRuleId`, this adds the new rule before the indicated rule. Otherwise, adds the new rule to the end of the list.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `clauses`: Array of clause objects, with `contextKind` (string), `attribute` (string), `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers, or dates) properties. The `contextKind`, `attribute`, and `values` are case sensitive. The `op` must be lower-case.\n- `beforeRuleId`: (Optional) ID of a flag rule.\n- Either\n  - `variationId`: ID of a variation of the flag.\n\n  or\n\n  - `rolloutWeights`: (Optional) Map of `variationId` to weight, in thousandths of a percent (0-100000).\n  - `rolloutBucketBy`: (Optional) Context attribute available in the specified `rolloutContextKind`.\n  - `rolloutContextKind`: (Optional) Context kind, defaults to `user`\n\nHere's an example that uses a `variationId`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addRule\",\n    \"variationId\": \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\",\n    \"clauses\": [{\n      \"contextKind\": \"organization\",\n      \"attribute\": \"located_in\",\n      \"op\": \"in\",\n      \"negate\": false,\n      \"values\": [\"Sweden\", \"Norway\"]\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nHere's an example that uses a percentage rollout:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addRule\",\n    \"clauses\": [{\n      \"contextKind\": \"organization\",\n      \"attribute\": \"located_in\",\n      \"op\": \"in\",\n      \"negate\": false,\n      \"values\": [\"Sweden\", \"Norway\"]\n    }],\n    \"rolloutContextKind\": \"organization\",\n    \"rolloutWeights\": {\n      \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\": 15000, // serve 15% this variation\n      \"e5830889-1ec5-4b0c-9cc9-c48790090c43\": 85000  // serve 85% this variation\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addTargets\n\nAdds context keys to the individual context targets for the context kind that `contextKind` specifies and the variation that `variationId` specifies.

They make changes that apply to the flag across all environments.\n\n#### addCustomProperties\n\nAdds a new custom property to the feature flag. Custom properties are used to associate feature flags with LaunchDarkly integrations. For example, if you create an integration with an issue tracking service, you may want to associate a flag with a list of issues related to a feature's development.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n - `key`: The custom property key.\n - `name`: The custom property name.\n - `values`: A list of the associated values for the custom property.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"instructions\": [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addCustomProperties\",\n\t\t\"key\": \"example-custom-property\",\n\t\t\"name\": \"Example custom property\",\n\t\t\"values\": [\"value1\", \"value2\"]\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addTags\n\nAdds tags to the feature flag.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: A list of tags to add.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"addTags\", \"values\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"] } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### makeFlagPermanent\n\nMarks the feature flag as permanent. LaunchDarkly does not prompt you to remove permanent flags, even if one variation is rolled out to all your customers.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"makeFlagPermanent\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### makeFlagTemporary\n\nMarks the feature flag as temporary.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"makeFlagTemporary\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeCustomProperties\n\nRemoves the associated values from a custom property.

This is equivalent to unchecking the **SDKs using Mobile Key** and/or **SDKs using client-side ID** boxes for the flag. If you're using a client-side or mobile SDK, you must expose your feature flags in order for the client-side or mobile SDKs to evaluate them.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Use \"usingMobileKey\" to turn off availability for mobile SDKs. Use \"usingEnvironmentId\" to turn on availability for client-side SDKs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnOffClientSideAvailability\", \"value\": \"usingMobileKey\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnOnClientSideAvailability\n\nTurns on client-side SDK availability for the flag. This is equivalent to unchecking the **SDKs using Mobile Key** and/or **SDKs using client-side ID** boxes for the flag. If you're using a client-side or mobile SDK, you must expose your feature flags in order for the client-side or mobile SDKs to evaluate them.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Use \"usingMobileKey\" to turn on availability for mobile SDKs. Use \"usingEnvironmentId\" to turn on availability for client-side SDKs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnOnClientSideAvailability\", \"value\": \"usingMobileKey\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateDescription\n\nUpdates the feature flag description.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new description.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateDescription\", \"value\": \"Updated flag description\" } ]\n}\n```\n#### updateMaintainerMember\n\nUpdates the maintainer of the flag to an existing member and removes the existing maintainer.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The ID of the member.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateMaintainerMember\", \"value\": \"61e9b714fd47591727db558a\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateMaintainerTeam\n\nUpdates the maintainer of the flag to an existing team and removes the existing maintainer.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The key of the team.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateMaintainerTeam\", \"value\": \"example-team-key\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates the feature flag name.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new name.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"updateName\", \"value\": \"Updated flag name\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand instructions for \u003cstrong\u003eupdating the flag lifecycle\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nThese instructions do not require the `environmentKey` parameter. They make changes that apply to the flag across all environments.\n\n#### archiveFlag\n\nArchives the feature flag. This retires it from LaunchDarkly without deleting it. You cannot archive a flag that is a prerequisite of other flags.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"archiveFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### deleteFlag\n\nDeletes the feature flag and its rules. You cannot restore a deleted flag. If this flag is requested again, the flag value defined in code will be returned for all contexts.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"deleteFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### deprecateFlag\n\nDeprecates the feature flag. This hides it from the live flags list without archiving or deleting it.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"deprecateFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### restoreDeprecatedFlag\n\nRestores the feature flag if it was previously deprecated.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"restoreDeprecatedFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### restoreFlag\n\nRestores the feature flag if it was previously archived.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"restoreFlag\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Using JSON patches on a feature flag\n\nIf you do not include the semantic patch header described above, you can use a [JSON patch](/reference#updates-using-json-patch) or [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) representation of the desired changes.\n\nIn the JSON patch representation, use a JSON pointer in the `path` element to describe what field to change. Use the [Get feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/getFeatureFlag) endpoint to find the field you want to update.\n\nThere are a few special cases to keep in mind when determining the value of the `path` element:\n\n  * To add an individual target to a specific variation if the flag variation already has individual targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/0/values/-\",\n      \"value\": \"TestClient10\"\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add an individual target to a specific variation if the flag variation does not already have individual targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/-\",\n      \"value\": { \"variation\": 0, \"values\": [\"TestClient10\"] }\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add a flag to a release pipeline, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/releasePipelineKey\",\n      \"value\": \"example-release-pipeline-key\"\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Required approvals\nIf a request attempts to alter a flag configuration in an environment where approvals are required for the flag, the request will fail with a 405. Changes to the flag configuration in that environment will require creating an [approval request](/tag/Approvals) or a [workflow](/tag/Workflows).\n\n### Conflicts\nIf a flag configuration change made through this endpoint would cause a pending scheduled change or approval request to fail, this endpoint will return a 400. You can ignore this check by adding an `ignoreConflicts` query parameter set to `true`.\n\n### Migration flags\nFor migration flags, the cohort information is included in the `rules` property of a flag's response. You can update cohorts by updating `rules`. Default cohort information is included in the `fallthrough` property of a flag's response. You can update the default cohort by updating `fallthrough`.\nWhen you update the rollout for a cohort or the default cohort through the API, provide a rollout instead of a single `variationId`.\nTo learn more, read [Migration Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).\n",

These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.\n\n### Filtering members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:\n\n- `query` is a string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `role` is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. It filters the list to members who have any of the roles in the list. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.\n- `team` is a string that matches against the key of the teams the members belong to. It is not case sensitive.\n- `noteam` is a boolean that filters the list of members who are not on a team if true and members on a team if false.\n- `lastSeen` is a JSON object in one of the following formats:\n  - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.\n  - `{\"noData\": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.\n  - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.\n- `accessCheck` is a string that represents a specific action on a specific resource and is in the format `\u003cActionSpecifier\u003e:\u003cResourceSpecifier\u003e`. It filters the list to members who have the ability to perform that action on that resource. Note: `accessCheck` is only supported in API version `20220603` and earlier. To learn more, read [Versioning](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/#section/Overview/Versioning).\n  - For example, the filter `accessCheck:createApprovalRequest:proj/default:env/test:flag/alternate-page` matches members with the ability to create an approval request for the `alternate-page` flag in the `test` environment of the `default` project.\n  - Wildcard and tag filters are not supported when filtering for access.\n\nFor example, the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole` matches members with the string `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case, who also are either an `Owner` or `Admin` or have the custom role `customrole`.\n\n### Sorting members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName` and `lastSeen`:\n\n- `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the member's email if no name is set.\n- `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen` property. LaunchDarkly considers members that have never been seen or have no data the oldest.\n",

It is not case sensitive.\n- `tags` is a `+`-separated list of project tags. It filters the list of projects that have all of the tags in the list.\n\nFor example, the filter `filter=query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches projects with the string `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\nThe documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2` must be encoded to `%2B`.\n\n### Sorting projects\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting:\n- `name` sorts by project name.\n- `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the project.\n\nFor example, `sort=name` sorts the response by project name in ascending order.\n\n### Expanding the projects response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the \"List projects\" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with the `environments` field.\n\n`Environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.\n* `environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.\n\nFor example, `expand=environments` includes the `environments` field for each project in the response.\n",

Use `/0` to add the new entry to the beginning of the array. Use `/-` to add the new entry to the end of the array.\n\nFor example, to add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"patch\":[\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/rules/0\",\n      \"value\": {\n        \"clauses\": [{ \"contextKind\": \"user\", \"attribute\": \"email\", \"op\": \"endsWith\", \"values\": [\".edu\"], \"negate\": false }]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo add or remove targets from segments, we recommend using semantic patch. Semantic patch for segments includes specific instructions for adding and removing both included and excluded targets.\n",

You can create a workflow directly, or you can apply a template to create a new workflow.\n\n### Creating a workflow\n\nYou can use the create workflow endpoint to create a workflow directly by adding a `stages` array to the request body.\n\nFor each stage, define the `name`, `conditions` when the stage should be executed, and `action` that describes the stage.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand example\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Progressive rollout starting in two days\",\n  \"description\": \"Turn flag targeting on and increase feature rollout in 10% increments each day\",\n  \"stages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"10% rollout on day 1\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"schedule\",\n          \"scheduleKind\": \"relative\", // or \"absolute\"\n              //  If \"scheduleKind\" is \"absolute\", set \"executionDate\";\n              // \"waitDuration\" and \"waitDurationUnit\" will be ignored\n          \"waitDuration\": 2,\n          \"waitDurationUnit\": \"calendarDay\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"ld-approval\",\n          \"notifyMemberIds\": [ \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ],\n          \"notifyTeamKeys\": [ \"team-key-123abc\" ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"action\": {\n        \"instructions\": [\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"updateFallthroughVariationOrRollout\",\n            \"rolloutWeights\": {\n              \"452f5fb5-7320-4ba3-81a1-8f4324f79d49\": 90000,\n              \"fc15f6a4-05d3-4aa4-a997-446be461345d\": 10000\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\n### Creating a workflow by applying a workflow template\n\nYou can also create a workflow by applying a workflow template. If you pass a valid workflow template key as the `templateKey` query parameter with the request, the API will attempt to create a new workflow with the stages defined in the workflow template with the corresponding key.\n\n#### Applicability of stages\nTemplates are created in the context of a particular flag in a particular environment in a particular project. However, because workflows created from a template can be applied to any project, environment, and flag, some steps of the workflow may need to be updated in order to be applicable for the target resource.\n\nYou can pass a `dryRun` query parameter to tell the API to return a report of which steps of the workflow template are applicable in the target project/environment/flag, and which will need to be updated. When the `dryRun` query parameter is present the response body includes a `meta` property that holds a list of parameters that could potentially be inapplicable for the target resource. Each of these parameters will include a `valid` field. You will need to update any invalid parameters in order to create the new workflow. You can do this using the `parameters` property, which overrides the workflow template parameters.\n\n#### Overriding template parameters\nYou can use the `parameters` property in the request body to tell the API to override the specified workflow template parameters with new values that are specific to your target project/environment/flag.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand example\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n\t\"name\": \"workflow created from my-template\",\n\t\"description\": \"description of my workflow\",\n\t\"parameters\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3b\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/clauses/0/values\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": [\"updated-segment\"]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3d\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/variationId\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd12\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nIf there are any steps in the template that are not applicable to the target resource, the workflow will not be created, and the `meta` property will be included in the response body detailing which parameters need to be updated.\n",
