// Package evaluation contains the LaunchDarkly Go SDK feature flag evaluation engine.
//
// Normal use of the Go SDK does not require referencing this package directly. It is used internally
// by the SDK, but is published and versioned separately so it can be used in other LaunchDarkly
// components without making the SDK versioning dependent on these internal APIs.
