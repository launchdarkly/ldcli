	// The underlying big segment store implementation will use a hash of the context key, rather

	// implementation rather than the evaluator, because there may already have a cached result for
	// that user, and we don't want to have to compute a hash repeatedly just to query a cache.
	//
	// Any given big segment is specific to one context kind, so we do not specify a context kind
	// here; it is OK for the membership results to include different context kinds for the same
	// key. That is, if for instance the context {kind: "user", key: "x"} is included in big segment
	// S1, and the context {kind: "org", key: "x"} is included in big segment S2, then the query
	// result for key "x" will show that it is included in both S1 and S2; even though those "x"
	// keys are really for two unrelated context kinds, we will always know which kind we mean if
	// we are specifically checking either S1 or S2, because S1 is defined as only applying to the
	// "user" kind and S2 is defined as only applying to the "org" kind.

	// whose CheckMembership method always returns an empty value.

// was called. Calling CheckMembership should not cause the state to be queried again. The object
// should be safe for concurrent access by multiple goroutines.

// This interface also exists in go-server-sdk because it is exposed as part of the public SDK API;
// users can write their own implementations of SDK components, but we do not want application code
// to reference go-server-sdk-evaluation symbols directly as part of that, because this library is
// versioned separately from the SDK. Currently the two interfaces are identical, but it might be
// that the go-server-sdk-evaluation version would diverge from the go-server-sdk version due to
// some internal requirements that aren't relevant to users, in which case go-server-sdk would be
// responsible for bridging the difference.
type BigSegmentMembership interface {
	// CheckMembership tests whether the user is explicitly included or explicitly excluded in the
	// specified segment, or neither. The segment is identified by a segmentRef which is not the

	// will provide. The store implementation should not be concerned with the format of this.
	//
	// If the user is explicitly included (regardless of whether the user is also explicitly
	// excluded or not-- that is, inclusion takes priority over exclusion), the method returns an
	// OptionalBool with a true value.

	// If the user is explicitly excluded, and is not explicitly included, the method returns an
	// OptionalBool with a false value.

	// value (so calling IsDefined() on it will return false).
