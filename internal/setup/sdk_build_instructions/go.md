# LaunchDarkly Sample Go Application

We've built a simple console application that demonstrates how LaunchDarkly's SDK works.

Below, you'll find the basic build procedure, but for more comprehensive instructions, you can visit your [Quickstart page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/quickstart#/) or the [Go SDK reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/go).

This demo requires Go 1.18 or higher.

## Build instructions

1. Edit `main.go` and set the value of `sdkKey` to your LaunchDarkly SDK key. If there is an existing boolean feature flag in your LaunchDarkly project that you want to evaluate, set `featureFlagKey` to the flag key.

```go
const sdkKey = "1234567890abcdef"

const featureFlagKey = "my-flag-key"
```

2. On the command line, run `go build`

3. Run `./hello-go`

You should see the message `"Feature flag 'my-flag-key' is <true/false> for this context"`.
