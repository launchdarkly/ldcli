    "description": "# Overview\n\n## Authentication\n\nLaunchDarkly's REST API uses the HTTPS protocol with a minimum TLS version of 1.2.\n\nAll REST API resources are authenticated with either [personal or service access tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens), or session cookies. Other authentication mechanisms are not supported. You can manage personal access tokens on your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\n\nLaunchDarkly also has SDK keys, mobile keys, and client-side IDs that are used by our server-side SDKs, mobile SDKs, and JavaScript-based SDKs, respectively. **These keys cannot be used to access our REST API**. These keys are environment-specific, and can only perform read-only operations such as fetching feature flag settings.\n\n| Auth mechanism                                                                                  | Allowed resources                                                                                     | Use cases                                          |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Personal or service access tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens) | Can be customized on a per-token basis                                                                | Building scripts, custom integrations, data export. |\n| SDK keys                                                                                        | Can only access read-only resources specific to server-side SDKs. Restricted to a single environment. | Server-side SDKs                     |\n| Mobile keys                                                                                     | Can only access read-only resources specific to mobile SDKs, and only for flags marked available to mobile keys.

Restricted to a single environment.           | Client-side JavaScript                             |\n\n> #### Keep your access tokens and SDK keys private\n>\n> Access tokens should _never_ be exposed in untrusted contexts. Never put an access token in client-side JavaScript, or embed it in a mobile application. LaunchDarkly has special mobile keys that you can embed in mobile apps. If you accidentally expose an access token or SDK key, you can reset it from your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\n>\n> The client-side ID is safe to embed in untrusted contexts. It's designed for use in client-side JavaScript.\n\n### Authentication using request header\n\nThe preferred way to authenticate with the API is by adding an `Authorization` header containing your access token to your requests. The value of the `Authorization` header must be your access token.\n\nManage personal access tokens from the [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\n\n### Authentication using session cookie\n\nFor testing purposes, you can make API calls directly from your web browser. If you are logged in to the LaunchDarkly application, the API will use your existing session to authenticate calls.\n\nIf you have a [role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/built-in-roles) other than Admin, or have a [custom role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/custom-roles) defined, you may not have permission to perform some API calls. You will receive a `401` response code in that case.\n\n> ### Modifying the Origin header causes an error\n>\n> LaunchDarkly validates that the Origin header for any API request authenticated by a session cookie matches the expected Origin header. The expected Origin header is `https://app.launchdarkly.com`.\n>\n> If the Origin header does not match what's expected, LaunchDarkly returns an error. This error can prevent the LaunchDarkly app from working correctly.\n>\n> Any browser extension that intentionally changes the Origin header can cause this problem. For example, the `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` Chrome extension changes the Origin header to `http://evil.com` and causes the app to fail.\n>\n> To prevent this error, do not modify your Origin header.\n>\n> LaunchDarkly does not require origin matching when authenticating with an access token, so this issue does not affect normal API usage.\n\n## Representations\n\nAll resources expect and return JSON response bodies. Error responses also send a JSON body. To learn more about the error format of the API, read [Errors](/#section/Overview/Errors).\n\nIn practice this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.\n\nIn addition, request bodies for `PATCH`, `POST`, and `PUT` requests must be encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.\n\n### Summary and detailed representations\n\nWhen you fetch a list of resources, the response includes only the most important attributes of each resource. This is a _summary representation_ of the resource. When you fetch an individual resource, such as a single feature flag, you receive a _detailed representation_ of the resource.\n\nThe best way to find a detailed representation is to follow links. Every summary representation includes a link to its detailed representation.\n\n### Expanding responses\n\nSometimes the detailed representation of a resource does not include all of the attributes of the resource by default. If this is the case, the request method will clearly document this and describe which attributes you can include in an expanded response.\n\nTo include the additional attributes, append the `expand` request parameter to your request and add a comma-separated list of the attributes to include. For example, when you append `?expand=members,roles` to the [Get team](/tag/Teams#operation/getTeam) endpoint, the expanded response includes both of these attributes.\n\n### Links and addressability\n\nThe best way to navigate the API is by following links. These are attributes in representations that link to other resources. The API always uses the same format for links:\n\n- Links to other resources within the API are encapsulated in a `_links` object\n- If the resource has a corresponding link to HTML content on the site, it is stored in a special `_site` link\n\nEach link has two attributes:\n\n- An `href`, which contains the URL\n- A `type`, which describes the content type\n\nFor example, a feature resource might return the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"parent\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/features\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/features/sort.order\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"_site\": {\n    \"href\": \"/features/sort.order\",\n    \"type\": \"text/html\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom this, you can navigate to the parent collection of features by following the `parent` link, or navigate to the site page for the feature by following the `_site` link.\n\nCollections are always represented as a JSON object with an `items` attribute containing an array of representations. Like all other representations, collections have `_links` defined at the top level.\n\nPaginated collections include `first`, `last`, `next`, and `prev` links containing a URL with the respective set of elements in the collection.\n\n## Updates\n\nResources that accept partial updates use the `PATCH` verb. Most resources support the [JSON patch](/reference#updates-using-json-patch) format. Some resources also support the [JSON merge patch](/reference#updates-using-json-merge-patch) format, and some resources support the [semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch) format, which is a way to specify the modifications to perform as a set of executable instructions. Each resource supports optional [comments](/reference#updates-with-comments) that you can submit with updates. Comments appear in outgoing webhooks, the audit log, and other integrations.\n\nWhen a resource supports both JSON patch and semantic patch, we document both in the request method. However, the specific request body fields and descriptions included in our documentation only match one type of patch or the other.\n\n### Updates using JSON patch\n\n[JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON patch uses paths and a limited set of operations to describe how to transform the current state of the resource into a new state. JSON patch documents are always arrays, where each element contains an operation, a path to the field to update, and the new value.\n\nFor example, in this feature flag representation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"New recommendations engine\",\n    \"key\": \"engine.enable\",\n    \"description\": \"This is the description\",\n    ...\n}\n```\nYou can change the feature flag's description with the following patch document:\n\n```json\n[{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"This is the new description\" }]\n```\n\nYou can specify multiple modifications to perform in a single request. You can also test that certain preconditions are met before applying the patch:\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"op\": \"test\", \"path\": \"/version\", \"value\": 10 },\n  { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"The new description\" }\n]\n```\n\nThe above patch request tests whether the feature flag's `version` is `10`, and if so, changes the feature flag's description.\n\nAttributes that are not editable, such as a resource's `_links`, have names that start with an underscore.\n\n### Updates using JSON merge patch\n\n[JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) is another format for specifying the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON merge patch is less expressive than JSON patch. However, in many cases it is simpler to construct a merge patch document. For example, you can change a feature flag's description with the following merge patch document:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": \"New flag description\"\n}\n```\n\n### Updates using semantic patch\n\nSome resources support the semantic patch format. A semantic patch is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource as a set of executable instructions.\n\nSemantic patch allows you to be explicit about intent using precise, custom instructions. In many cases, you can define semantic patch instructions independently of the current state of the resource. This can be useful when defining a change that may be applied at a future date.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```\nContent-Type: application/json; domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch\n```\n\nIf you call a semantic patch resource without this header, you will receive a `400` response because your semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON patch.\n\nThe body of a semantic patch request takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some resources only) The environment key.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the instruction requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object. The documentation for each resource that supports semantic patch includes the available instructions and any additional parameters.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"} ]\n}\n```\n\nIf any instruction in the patch encounters an error, the endpoint returns an error and will not change the resource. In general, each instruction silently does nothing if the resource is already in the state you request.\n\n### Updates with comments\n\nYou can submit optional comments with `PATCH` changes.\n\nTo submit a comment along with a JSON patch document, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"patch\": [{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"The new description\" }]\n}\n```\n\nTo submit a comment along with a JSON merge patch document, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"merge\": { \"description\": \"New flag description\" }\n}\n```\n\nTo submit a comment along with a semantic patch, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"instructions\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"} ]\n}\n```\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API always returns errors in a common format. Here's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"code\": \"invalid_request\",\n  \"message\": \"A feature with that key already exists\",\n  \"id\": \"30ce6058-87da-11e4-b116-123b93f75cba\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `code` indicates the general class of error. The `message` is a human-readable explanation of what went wrong. The `id` is a unique identifier. Use it when you're working with LaunchDarkly Support to debug a problem with a specific API call.\n\n### HTTP status error response codes\n\n| Code | Definition        | Description                                                                                       | Possible Solution                                                |\n| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 400  | Invalid request       | The request cannot be understood.                                    | Ensure JSON syntax in request body is correct.                   |\n| 401  | Invalid access token      | Requestor is unauthorized or does not have permission for this API call.                                                | Ensure your API access token is valid and has the appropriate permissions.                                     |\n| 403  | Forbidden         | Requestor does not have access to this resource.                                                | Ensure that the account member or access token has proper permissions set. |\n| 404  | Invalid resource identifier | The requested resource is not valid. | Ensure that the resource is correctly identified by ID or key. |\n| 405  | Method not allowed | The request method is not allowed on this resource. | Ensure that the HTTP verb is correct. |\n| 409  | Conflict          | The API request can not be completed because it conflicts with a concurrent API request. | Retry your request.                                              |\n| 422  | Unprocessable entity | The API request can not be completed because the update description can not be understood. | Ensure that the request body is correct for the type of patch you are using, either JSON patch or semantic patch.\n| 429  | Too many requests | Read [Rate limiting](/#section/Overview/Rate-limiting).                                               | Wait and try again later.                                        |\n\n## CORS\n\nThe LaunchDarkly API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. If an `Origin` header is given in a request, it will be echoed as an explicitly allowed origin. Otherwise the request returns a wildcard, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. For more information on CORS, read the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors). Example CORS headers might look like:\n\n```http\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAccess-Control-Max-Age: 300\n```\n\nYou can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin calls, using either [token or session-based authentication](/#section/Overview/Authentication). If you are using session authentication, you should set the `withCredentials` property for your `xhr` request to `true`. You should never expose your access tokens to untrusted entities.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nWe use several rate limiting strategies to ensure the availability of our APIs. Rate-limited calls to our APIs return a `429` status code. Calls to our APIs include headers indicating the current rate limit status. The specific headers returned depend on the API route being called. The limits differ based on the route, authentication mechanism, and other factors. Routes that are not rate limited may not contain any of the headers described below.\n\n> ### Rate limiting and SDKs\n>\n> LaunchDarkly SDKs are never rate limited and do not use the API endpoints defined here. LaunchDarkly uses a different set of approaches, including streaming/server-sent events and a global CDN, to ensure availability to the routes used by LaunchDarkly SDKs.\n\n### Global rate limits\n\nAuthenticated requests are subject to a global limit. This is the maximum number of calls that your account can make to the API per ten seconds. All service and personal access tokens on the account share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token will impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to global rate limits may return the headers below:\n\n| Header name                    | Description                                                                      |\n| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Global-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`            | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.    |\n\nWe do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be made globally. This limit may change, and we encourage clients to program against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding to the current limit.\n\n### Route-level rate limits\n\nSome authenticated routes have custom rate limits. These also reset every ten seconds. Any service or personal access tokens hitting the same route share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token may impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to route-level rate limits return the headers below:\n\n| Header name                   | Description                                                                                           |\n| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Route-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests to the current route the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`           | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.                         |\n\nA _route_ represents a specific URL pattern and verb. For example, the [Delete environment](/tag/Environments#operation/deleteEnvironment) endpoint is considered a single route, and each call to delete an environment counts against your route-level rate limit for that route.\n\nWe do not publicly document the specific number of calls that an account can make to each endpoint per ten seconds. These limits may change, and we encourage clients to program against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding to the current limits.\n\n### IP-based rate limiting\n\nWe also employ IP-based rate limiting on some API routes. If you hit an IP-based rate limit, your API response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before re-trying the call. Clients must wait at least `Retry-After` seconds before making additional calls to our API, and should employ jitter and backoff strategies to avoid triggering rate limits again.\n\n## OpenAPI (Swagger) and client libraries\n\nWe have a [complete OpenAPI (Swagger) specification](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/openapi.json) for our API.\n\nWe auto-generate multiple client libraries based on our OpenAPI specification. To learn more, visit the [collection of client libraries on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-api+org%3Alaunchdarkly&type=Repositories). You can also use this specification to generate client libraries to interact with our REST API in your language of choice.\n\nOur OpenAPI specification is supported by several API-based tools such as Postman and Insomnia. In many cases, you can directly import our specification to explore our APIs.\n\n## Method overriding\n\nSome firewalls and HTTP clients restrict the use of verbs other than `GET` and `POST`. In those environments, our API endpoints that use `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` verbs are inaccessible.\n\nTo avoid this issue, our API supports the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, allowing clients to \"tunnel\" `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests using a `POST` request.\n\nFor example, to call a `PATCH` endpoint using a `POST` request, you can include `X-HTTP-Method-Override:PATCH` as a header.\n\n## Beta resources\n\nWe sometimes release new API resources in **beta** status before we release them with general availability.\n\nResources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.\n\nWe try to promote resources into general availability as quickly as possible. This happens after sufficient testing and when we're satisfied that we no longer need to make backwards-incompatible changes.\n\nWe mark beta resources with a \"Beta\" callout in our documentation, pictured below:\n\n> ### This feature is in beta\n>\n> To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](/#section/Overview/Beta-resources).\n>\n> Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.\n\n### Using beta resources\n\nTo use a beta resource, you must include a header in the request. If you call a beta resource without this header, you receive a `403` response.\n\nUse this header:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: beta\n```\n\n## Federal environments\n\nThe version of LaunchDarkly that is available on domains controlled by the United States government is different from the version of LaunchDarkly available to the general public. If you are an employee or contractor for a United States federal agency and use LaunchDarkly in your work, you likely use the federal instance of LaunchDarkly.\n\nIf you are working in the federal instance of LaunchDarkly, the base URI for each request is `https://app.launchdarkly.us`. In the \"Try it\" sandbox for each request, click the request path to view the complete resource path for the federal environment.\n\nTo learn more, read [LaunchDarkly in federal environments](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/advanced/federal).\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe try hard to keep our REST API backwards compatible, but we occasionally have to make backwards-incompatible changes in the process of shipping new features. These breaking changes can cause unexpected behavior if you don't prepare for them accordingly.\n\nUpdates to our REST API include support for the latest features in LaunchDarkly. We also release a new version of our REST API every time we make a breaking change. We provide simultaneous support for multiple API versions so you can migrate from your current API version to a new version at your own pace.\n\n### Setting the API version per request\n\nYou can set the API version on a specific request by sending an `LD-API-Version` header, as shown in the example below:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: 20240415\n```\n\nThe header value is the version number of the API version you would like to request. The number for each version corresponds to the date the version was released in `yyyymmdd` format. In the example above the version `20240415` corresponds to April 15, 2024.\n\n### Setting the API version per access token\n\nWhen you create an access token, you must specify a specific version of the API to use. This ensures that integrations using this token cannot be broken by version changes.\n\nTokens created before versioning was released have their version set to `20160426`, which is the version of the API that existed before the current versioning scheme, so that they continue working the same way they did before versioning.\n\nIf you would like to upgrade your integration to use a new API version, you can explicitly set the header described above.\n\n> ### Best practice: Set the header for every client or integration\n>\n> We recommend that you set the API version header explicitly in any client or integration you build.\n>\n> Only rely on the access token API version during manual testing.\n\n### API version changelog\n\n|<div style=\"width:75px\">Version</div> | Changes | End of life (EOL)\n|---|---|---|\n| `20240415` | <ul><li>Changed several endpoints from unpaginated to paginated.

You can use applications to target particular application versions in your feature flags more easily, and to handle unsupported application versions more gracefully.\n\nIn addition to creating applications through the applications API, you can also create applications in the LaunchDarkly user interface. To learn more, read [Applications](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/organize/applications). LaunchDarkly also creates applications and application versions automatically when a LaunchDarkly SDK evaluates a feature flag for a context that includes application information. To learn more, read [Automatic environment attributes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/environment-attributes).\n\nYou can use an application in any project in your LaunchDarkly account.\n\n### Filtering applications and application versions\n\nThe `filter` parameter supports the following operators: `equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith`.\n\nYou can also combine filters in the following ways:\n\n- Use a comma (`,`) as an AND operator\n- Use a vertical bar (`|`) as an OR operator\n- Use parentheses (`()`) to group filters\n\n#### Supported fields and operators\n\nYou can only filter certain fields in applications when using the `filter` parameter. Additionally, you can only filter some fields with certain operators.\n\nWhen you search for applications, the `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators:\n\n|<div style=\"width:120px\">Field</div> |Description |Supported operators |\n|---|---|---|\n|`key` | The application or application version key, a unique identifier |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`name` | The application name or application version name |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |\n|`autoAdded` | Whether the application or application version was automatically created because it was included in a context when a LaunchDarkly SDK evaluated a feature flag, or was created through the LaunchDarkly UI or REST API |`equals`, `notEquals` |\n|`kind` | The application kind, one of `mobile`, `server`, `browser`. Only available for [Get applications](/tag/Applications-(beta)#operation/getApplications). |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`supported` | Whether a mobile application version is supported or unsupported. Only available for [Get application versions by application key](/tag/Applications-(beta)#operation/getApplicationVersions).|`equals`, `notEquals` |\n\nFor example, the filter `?filter=kind anyOf ['mobile', 'server']` matches applications whose `kind` is either `mobile` or `server`. The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\nThe documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `[` in `?filter=kind anyOf ['mobile', 'server']` must be encoded to `%5B`.\n\n### Sorting applications and application versions\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the following fields for sorting:\n- `name` sorts by application name.\n- `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the application.\n\nBy default, the sort is in ascending order. Use `-` to sort in descending order. For example, `?sort=name` sorts the response by application name in ascending order, and `?sort=-name` sorts in descending order.\n"

Contexts are identified by their `kind`, which describes the type of resources encountering flags, and by their `key`. Each unique combination of one or more contexts that have encountered a feature flag in your product is called a context instance.\n\nWhen you use the LaunchDarkly SDK to evaluate a flag, you provide a context to that call. LaunchDarkly records the key and attributes of each context instance. You can view these in the LaunchDarkly user interface from the **Contexts** list, or use the Context APIs. To learn more, read [Contexts](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts).\n\nLaunchDarkly provides APIs for you to:\n\n* retrieve contexts, context instances, and context attribute names and values\n* search for contexts or context instances\n* delete context instances\n* fetch context kinds\n* create and update context kinds\n\nTo learn more about context kinds, read [Context kinds](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/contexts/context-kinds).\n\nContexts are always scoped within a project and an environment. Each environment has its own set of context instance records.\n\nSeveral of the endpoints in the contexts API require a context instance ID or application ID. Both of these IDs are returned as part of the [Search for context instances](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContextInstances) response. The context instance ID is the `id` field of each element in the `items` array. The application ID is the `applicationId` field of each element in the `items` array. By default, the application ID is set to the SDK you are using. In the LaunchDarkly UI, the application ID and application version appear on the context details page in the \"From source\" field. You can change the application ID as part of your SDK configuration. To learn more, read [Application metadata configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/app-config).\n\n### Filtering contexts and context instances\n\nWhen you [search for contexts](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContexts) or [context instances](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContextInstances), you can filter on certain fields using the `filter` parameter either as a query parameter or as a request body parameter.\n\nThe `filter` parameter supports the following operators: `after`, `anyOf`, `before`, `contains`, `equals`, `exists`, `notEquals`, `startsWith`.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for details on operators and syntax</summary>\n\n#### after\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field, which should be dates, are after the provided time. For example:\n\n* `myField after \"2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00\"`\n\n#### anyOf\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field match any of the values in the match value. For example:\n\n* `myField anyOf [44]`\n* `myField anyOf [\"phone\",\"tablet\"]`\n* `myField anyOf [true]\"`\n\n#### before\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if any of the values in a field, which should be dates, are before the provided time. For example:\n\n* `myField before \"2022-09-21T19:03:15+00:00\"`\n\n#### contains\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if all the match values are found in the list of values in this field. For example:\n\n* `myListField contains 44`\n* `myListField contains [\"phone\",\"tablet\"]`\n* `myListField contains true`\n\n#### equals\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if there is an exact match on the entire field. For example:\n\n* `myField equals 44`\n* `myField equals \"device\"`\n* `myField equals true`\n* `myField equals [1,2,3,4]`\n* `myField equals [\"hello\",\"goodbye\"]`\n\n#### exists\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if the field matches the specified existence. For example:\n\n* `myField exists true`\n* `myField exists false`\n* `*.name exists true`\n\n#### notEquals\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if there is not an exact match on the entire field. For example:\n\n* `myField notEquals 44`\n* `myField notEquals \"device\"`\n* `myField notEquals true`\n* `myField notEquals [1,2,3,4]`\n* `myField notEquals [\"hello\",\"goodbye\"]`\n\n#### startsWith\n\nReturns contexts or context instances if the value in a field, which should be a singular string, begins with the provided substring. For example:\n\n* `myField startsWith \"do\"`\n\n</details>\n\nYou can also combine filters in the following ways:\n\n* Use a comma (`,`) as an AND operator\n* Use a vertical bar (`|`) as an OR operator\n* Use parentheses `()` to group filters\n\nFor example:\n\n* `myField notEquals 0, myField notEquals 1` returns contexts or context instances where `myField` is not 0 and is not 1\n* `myFirstField equals \"device\",(mySecondField equals \"iPhone\"|mySecondField equals \"iPad\")` returns contexts or context instances where `myFirstField` is equal to \"device\" and `mySecondField` is equal to either \"iPhone\" or \"iPad\"\n\n#### Supported fields and operators\n\nYou can only filter certain fields in contexts and context instances when using the `filter` parameter. Additionally, you can only filter some fields with certain operators.\n\nWhen you search for [contexts]((/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContexts)), the `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators:\n\n|<div style=\"width:120px\">Field</div> |Description |Supported operators |\n|---|---|---|\n|`applicationId` |An identifier representing the application where the LaunchDarkly SDK is running. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`id` |Unique identifier for the context. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`key` |The context key. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |\n|`kind` |The context kind. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`kinds` |A list of all kinds found in the context.

Supply a string or list of strings to the operator.  |`equals` |\n|`name` |The name for the context. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `exists`, `anyOf`, `startsWith` |\n|`<a kind>.<an attribute name>` |A kind and the name of any attribute that appears in a context of that kind, for example, `user.email`. To filter all kinds, use `*` in place of the kind, for example, `*.email`. You can use either a literal attribute name or a JSON path to specify the attribute. If you use a JSON path, then you must escape the `/` character, using `~1`, and the `~` character, using `~0`. For example, use `user.job/title` or `user./job~1title` to filter the `/job/title` field in a user context kind. If the field or value includes whitespace, it should be enclosed in double quotes. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `exists`, `startsWith`, `before`, `after`.|\n\nWhen searching for [context instances](/tag/Contexts#operation/searchContextInstances), the `filter` parameter supports the following fields and operators\n\n|<div style=\"width:120px\">Field</div> |Description |Supported operators |\n|---|---|---|\n|`applicationId` |An identifier representing the application where the LaunchDarkly SDK is running. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`id` |Unique identifier for the context instance. |`equals`, `notEquals`, `anyOf` |\n|`kinds` |A list of all kinds found in the context instance.

For a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and `false`. Multivariate flags have more variation values, and those values could be any JSON type: numbers, strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting rules, the variations are referred to by their index into this array.\n\nTo update these attributes, read [Update feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag), especially the instructions for **updating flag settings**.\n\n### Per-environment configurations\n\nEach entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object that represents the environment-specific flag configuration data available in the flag's Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Targeting with flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags).\n\nTo update per-environment information for a flag, read [Update feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag), especially the instructions for **turning flags on and off** and **working with targeting and variations**.\n\n### Individual context targets\n\nThe `targets` and `contextTargets` arrays in the per-environment configuration data correspond to the individual context targeting on the Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Individual targeting](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/individual-targeting).\n\nEach object in the `targets` and `contextTargets` arrays represents a list of context keys assigned to a particular variation. The `targets` array includes contexts with `contextKind` of \"user\" and the `contextTargets` array includes contexts with context kinds other than \"user.\"\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"environments\" : {\n    \"production\" : {\n      ...\n      \"targets\": [\n        {\n          \"values\": [\"user-key-123abc\"],\n          \"variation\": 0,\n          \"contextKind\": \"user\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"contextTargets\": [\n        {\n          \"values\": [\"org-key-123abc\"],\n          \"variation\": 0,\n          \"contextKind\": \"organization\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `targets` array means that any user context instance with the key `user-key-123abc` receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. The `contextTargets` array means that any organization context with the key `org-key-123abc` receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. Recall that the variations are stored at the top level of the flag JSON in an array, and the per-environment configuration rules point to indexes into this array. If this is a boolean flag, both contexts are receiving the `true` variation.\n\n### Targeting rules\n\nThe `rules` array corresponds to the rules section of the Targeting tab. This is where you can express complex rules on attributes with conditions and operators. For example, you might create a rule that specifies \"roll out the `true` variation to 80% of contexts whose email address ends with `gmail.com`\". To learn more, read [Creating targeting rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/targeting-flags/targeting-rules#creating-targeting-rules).\n\n### The fallthrough rule\n\nThe `fallthrough` object is a special rule that contains no conditions. It is the rollout strategy that is applied when none of the individual or custom targeting rules match. In the LaunchDarkly UI, it is called the \"Default rule.\"\n\n### The off variation\n\nThe off variation represents the variation to serve if the feature flag targeting is turned off, meaning the `on` attribute is `false`. For boolean flags, this is usually `false`. For multivariate flags, set the off variation to whatever variation represents the control or baseline behavior for your application. If you don't set the off variation, LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.\n\n### Percentage rollouts\n\nWhen you work with targeting rules and with the default rule, you can specify either a single variation or a percentage rollout. The `weight` attribute defines the percentage rollout for each variation. Weights range from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout). The weights are scaled by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can be represented without using floating-point. For example, a weight of `60000` means that 60% of contexts will receive that variation. The sum of weights across all variations should be 100%.\n"

To learn more, read [Get audit log entry](/tag/Audit-log#operation/getAuditLogEntry).\n\nHere's a sample payload:\n\n> ### Webhook delivery order\n>\n> Webhooks may not be delivered in chronological order. We recommend using the payload's \"date\" field as a timestamp to reorder webhooks as they are received.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"canonical\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/v2/projects/alexis/environments/test\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"parent\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/v2/auditlog\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/v2/auditlog/57c0a8e29969090743529965\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"site\": {\n      \"href\": \"/settings#/projects\",\n      \"type\": \"text/html\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"_id\": \"57c0a8e29969090743529965\",\n  \"date\": 1472243938774,\n  \"accesses\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateName\",\n      \"resource\": \"proj/alexis:env/test\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"kind\": \"environment\",\n  \"name\": \"Testing\",\n  \"description\": \"- Changed the name from ~~Test~~ to *Testing*\",\n  \"member\": {\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"href\": \"/internal/account/members\",\n        \"type\": \"application/json\"\n      },\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/internal/account/members/548f6741c1efad40031b18ae\",\n        \"type\": \"application/json\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"_id\": \"548f6741c1efad40031b18ae\",\n    \"email\": \"ariel@acme.com\",\n    \"firstName\": \"Ariel\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Flores\"\n  },\n  \"titleVerb\": \"changed the name of\",\n  \"title\": \"[Ariel Flores](mailto:ariel@acme.com) changed the name of [Testing](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)\",\n  \"target\": {\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"canonical\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/v2/projects/alexis/environments/test\",\n        \"type\": \"application/json\"\n      },\n      \"site\": {\n        \"href\": \"/settings#/projects\",\n        \"type\": \"text/html\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"name\": \"Testing\",\n    \"resources\": [\"proj/alexis:env/test\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Signing the webhook\n\nOptionally, you can define a `secret` when you create a webhook. If you define the secret, the webhook `POST` request will include an `X-LD-Signature header`, whose value will contain an HMAC SHA256 hex digest of the webhook payload, using the `secret` as the key.\n\nCompute the signature of the payload using the same shared secret in your code to verify that the webhook was triggered by LaunchDarkly.\n\n## Understanding connection retries\n\nIf LaunchDarkly receives a non-`2xx` response to a webhook `POST`, it will retry the delivery one time. Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If you build an integration on webhooks, make sure it is tolerant of delivery failures.\n"

For example: `filter=notifyMemberIds anyOf [\"memberId1\", \"memberId2\"]`.\n- `requestorId` filters for only approvals that correspond to the ID of the member who requested the approval. For example: `filter=requestorId equals 457034721476302714390214`.\n- `resourceId` filters for only approvals that correspond to the the specified resource identifier. For example: `filter=resourceId equals proj/my-project:env/my-environment:flag/my-flag`.\n- `reviewStatus` filters for only approvals which correspond to the review status in the specified list. The possible values are `approved`, `declined`, and `pending`. For example: `filter=reviewStatus anyOf [\"pending\", \"approved\"]`.\n- `status` filters for only approvals which correspond to the status in the specified list. The possible values are `pending`, `scheduled`, `failed`, and `completed`. For example: `filter=status anyOf [\"pending\", \"scheduled\"]`.\n\nYou can also apply multiple filters at once. For example, setting `filter=projectKey equals my-project, reviewStatus anyOf [\"pending\",\"approved\"]` matches approval requests which correspond to the `my-project` project key, and a review status of either `pending` or `approved`.\n\n### Expanding approval response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional fields in the response, with the following fields:\n\n- `flag` includes the flag the approval request belongs to\n- `project` includes the project the approval request belongs to\n- `environments` includes the environments the approval request relates to\n\nFor example, `expand=project,flag` includes the `project` and `flag` fields in the response.\n",

You can filter environments with the `env` query parameter. For example, setting `env=production` restricts the returned configurations to just your production environment. You can also filter feature flags by tag with the `tag` query parameter.\n\n> #### Recommended use\n>\n> This endpoint can return a large amount of information. We recommend using some or all of these query parameters to decrease response time and overall payload size: `limit`, `env`, `query`, and `filter=creationDate`.\n\n### Filtering flags\n\nYou can filter on certain fields using the `filter` query parameter. For example, setting `filter=query:dark-mode,tags:beta+test` matches flags with the string `dark-mode` in their key or name, ignoring case, which also have the tags `beta` and `test`.\n\nThe `filter` query parameter supports the following arguments:\n\n| Filter argument       | Description | Example              |\n|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| `applicationEvaluated`  | A string. It filters the list to flags that are evaluated in the application with the given key. | `filter=applicationEvaluated:com.launchdarkly.cafe` |\n| `archived`              | (deprecated) A boolean value. It filters the list to archived flags. | Use `filter=state:archived` instead |\n| `contextKindsEvaluated` | A `+`-separated list of context kind keys. It filters the list to flags which have been evaluated in the past 30 days for all of the context kinds in the list. | `filter=contextKindsEvaluated:user+application` |\n| `codeReferences.max`    | An integer value. Use `0` to return flags that do not have code references. | `filter=codeReferences.max:0` |\n| `codeReferences.min`    | An integer value. Use `1` to return flags that do have code references. | `filter=codeReferences.min:1` |\n| `creationDate`          | An object with an optional `before` field whose value is Unix time in milliseconds. It filters the list to flags created before the date. | `filter=creationDate:{\"before\":1690527600000}` |\n| `evaluated`             | An object that contains a key of `after` and a value in Unix time in milliseconds. It filters the list to all flags that have been evaluated since the time you specify, in the environment provided. This filter requires the `filterEnv` filter. | `filter=evaluated:{\"after\":1690527600000},filterEnv:production` |\n| `filterEnv`             | A string with a list of comma-separated keys of valid environments. You must use this field for filters that are environment-specific. If there are multiple environment-specific filters, you only need to include this field once. You can filter for a maximum of three environments. | `filter=evaluated:{\"after\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production,status:active` |\n| `hasExperiment`         | A boolean value. It filters the list to flags that are used in an experiment. | `filter=hasExperiment:true` |\n| `maintainerId`          | A valid member ID. It filters the list to flags that are maintained by this member. | `filter=maintainerId:12ab3c45de678910abc12345` |\n| `maintainerTeamKey`     | A string. It filters the list to flags that are maintained by the team with this key. | `filter=maintainerTeamKey:example-team-key` |\n| `query`                 | A string. It filters the list to flags that include the specified string in their key or name. It is not case sensitive. | `filter=query:example` |\n| `state`                 | A string, either `live`, `deprecated`, or `archived`. It filters the list to flags in this state. | `filter=state:archived` |\n| `sdkAvailability`       | A string, one of `client`, `mobile`, `anyClient`, `server`. Using `client` filters the list to flags whose client-side SDK availability is set to use the client-side ID. Using `mobile` filters to flags set to use the mobile key. Using `anyClient` filters to flags set to use either the client-side ID or the mobile key. Using `server` filters to flags set to use neither, that is, to flags only available in server-side SDKs.  | `filter=sdkAvailability:client` |\n| `tags`                  | A `+`-separated list of tags. It filters the list to flags that have all of the tags in the list. | `filter=tags:beta+test` |\n| `type`                  | A string, either `temporary` or `permanent`. It filters the list to flags with the specified type. | `filter=type:permanent` |\n\nThe documented values for the `filter` query are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:beta+test` must be encoded to `%2B`.\n\nBy default, this endpoint returns all flags. You can page through the list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links will not be present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.\n\n### Sorting flags\n\nYou can sort flags based on the following fields:\n\n- `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the flag.\n- `key` sorts by the key of the flag.\n- `maintainerId` sorts by the flag maintainer.\n- `name` sorts by flag name.\n- `tags` sorts by tags.\n- `targetingModifiedDate` sorts by the date that the flag's targeting rules were last modified in a given environment. It must be used with `env` parameter and it can not be combined with any other sort. If multiple `env` values are provided, it will perform sort using the first one. For example, `sort=-targetingModifiedDate&env=production&env=staging` returns results sorted by `targetingModifiedDate` for the `production` environment.\n- `type` sorts by flag type\n\nAll fields are sorted in ascending order by default. To sort in descending order, prefix the field with a dash ( - ). For example, `sort=-name` sorts the response by flag name in descending order.\n\n### Expanding response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional fields in the response, with the following fields:\n\n- `codeReferences` includes code references for the feature flag\n- `evaluation` includes evaluation information within returned environments, including which context kinds the flag has been evaluated for in the past 30 days\n- `migrationSettings` includes migration settings information within the flag and within returned environments. These settings are only included for migration flags, that is, where `purpose` is `migration`.\n\nFor example, `expand=evaluation` includes the `evaluation` field in the response.\n\n### Migration flags\nFor migration flags, the cohort information is included in the `rules` property of a flag's response, and default cohort information is included in the `fallthrough` property of a flag's response.\nTo learn more, read [Migration Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).\n",

Specifying one or multiple environments with the `env` parameter can decrease response time and overall payload size. We recommend using this parameter to return only the environments relevant to your query.\n\n### Expanding response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the `expand` query param to include additional fields in the response, with the following fields:\n\n- `evaluation` includes evaluation information within returned environments, including which context kinds the flag has been evaluated for in the past 30 days \n- `migrationSettings` includes migration settings information within the flag and within returned environments. These settings are only included for migration flags, that is, where `purpose` is `migration`.\n\nFor example, `expand=evaluation` includes the `evaluation` field in the response.\n",

        "description": "Perform a partial update to a feature flag. The request body must be a valid semantic patch, JSON patch, or JSON merge patch. To learn more the different formats, read [Updates](/#section/Overview/Updates).\n\n### Using semantic patches on a feature flag\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nThe body of a semantic patch request for updating feature flags takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some instructions only) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object. The body of a single semantic patch can contain many different instructions.\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating feature flags.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>turning flags on and off</strong></summary>\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey` parameter.\n\n#### turnFlagOff\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **Off**.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnFlagOn\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **On**.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n</details><br />\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>working with targeting and variations</strong></summary>\n\nThese instructions require the `environmentKey` parameter.\n\nSeveral of the instructions for working with targeting and variations require flag rule IDs, variation IDs, or clause IDs as parameters. Each of these are returned as part of the [Get feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/getFeatureFlag) response. The flag rule ID is the `_id` field of each element in the `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object. The variation ID is the `_id` field in each element of the `variations` array. The clause ID is the `_id` field of each element of the `clauses` array within the `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object.\n\n#### addClauses\n\nAdds the given clauses to the rule indicated by `ruleId`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauses`: Array of clause objects, with `contextKind` (string), `attribute` (string), `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers, or dates) properties. The `contextKind`, `attribute`, and `values` are case sensitive. The `op` must be lower-case.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n\t\"instructions\": [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addClauses\",\n\t\t\"ruleId\": \"a902ef4a-2faf-4eaf-88e1-ecc356708a29\",\n\t\t\"clauses\": [{\n\t\t\t\"contextKind\": \"user\",\n\t\t\t\"attribute\": \"country\",\n\t\t\t\"op\": \"in\",\n\t\t\t\"negate\": false,\n\t\t\t\"values\": [\"USA\", \"Canada\"]\n\t\t}]\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addPrerequisite\n\nAdds the flag indicated by `key` with variation `variationId` as a prerequisite to the flag in the path parameter.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `key`: Flag key of the prerequisite flag.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation of the prerequisite flag.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n\t\"instructions\": [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addPrerequisite\",\n\t\t\"key\": \"example-prereq-flag-key\",\n\t\t\"variationId\": \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\"\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addRule\n\nAdds a new targeting rule to the flag. The rule may contain `clauses` and serve the variation that `variationId` indicates, or serve a percentage rollout that `rolloutWeights`, `rolloutBucketBy`, and `rolloutContextKind` indicate.\n\nIf you set `beforeRuleId`, this adds the new rule before the indicated rule. Otherwise, adds the new rule to the end of the list.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `clauses`: Array of clause objects, with `contextKind` (string), `attribute` (string), `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers, or dates) properties. The `contextKind`, `attribute`, and `values` are case sensitive. The `op` must be lower-case.\n- `beforeRuleId`: (Optional) ID of a flag rule.\n- Either\n  - `variationId`: ID of a variation of the flag.\n\n  or\n\n  - `rolloutWeights`: (Optional) Map of `variationId` to weight, in thousandths of a percent (0-100000).\n  - `rolloutBucketBy`: (Optional) Context attribute available in the specified `rolloutContextKind`.\n  - `rolloutContextKind`: (Optional) Context kind, defaults to `user`\n\nHere's an example that uses a `variationId`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addRule\",\n    \"variationId\": \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\",\n    \"clauses\": [{\n      \"contextKind\": \"organization\",\n      \"attribute\": \"located_in\",\n      \"op\": \"in\",\n      \"negate\": false,\n      \"values\": [\"Sweden\", \"Norway\"]\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nHere's an example that uses a percentage rollout:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addRule\",\n    \"clauses\": [{\n      \"contextKind\": \"organization\",\n      \"attribute\": \"located_in\",\n      \"op\": \"in\",\n      \"negate\": false,\n      \"values\": [\"Sweden\", \"Norway\"]\n    }],\n    \"rolloutContextKind\": \"organization\",\n    \"rolloutWeights\": {\n      \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\": 15000, // serve 15% this variation\n      \"e5830889-1ec5-4b0c-9cc9-c48790090c43\": 85000  // serve 85% this variation\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addTargets\n\nAdds context keys to the individual context targets for the context kind that `contextKind` specifies and the variation that `variationId` specifies. Returns an error if this causes the flag to target the same context key in multiple variations.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of context keys.\n- `contextKind`: (Optional) Context kind to target, defaults to `user`\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"environmentKey\": \"environment-key-123abc\",\n\t\"instructions\": [{\n\t\t\"kind\": \"addTargets\",\n\t\t\"values\": [\"context-key-123abc\", \"context-key-456def\"],\n\t\t\"variationId\": \"2f43f67c-3e4e-4945-a18a-26559378ca00\"\n\t}]\n}\n```\n\n#### addUserTargets\n\nAdds user keys to the individual user targets for the variation that `variationId` specifies.

Use the [Get feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/getFeatureFlag) endpoint to find the field you want to update.\n\nThere are a few special cases to keep in mind when determining the value of the `path` element:\n\n  * To add an individual target to a specific variation if the flag variation already has individual targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/0/values/-\",\n      \"value\": \"TestClient10\"\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add an individual target to a specific variation if the flag variation does not already have individual targets, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/environments/devint/targets/-\",\n      \"value\": { \"variation\": 0, \"values\": [\"TestClient10\"] }\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  * To add a flag to a release pipeline, the path for the JSON patch operation is:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/releasePipelineKey\",\n      \"value\": \"example-release-pipeline-key\"\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Required approvals\nIf a request attempts to alter a flag configuration in an environment where approvals are required for the flag, the request will fail with a 405. Changes to the flag configuration in that environment will require creating an [approval request](/tag/Approvals) or a [workflow](/tag/Workflows).\n\n### Conflicts\nIf a flag configuration change made through this endpoint would cause a pending scheduled change or approval request to fail, this endpoint will return a 400. You can ignore this check by adding an `ignoreConflicts` query parameter set to `true`.\n\n### Migration flags\nFor migration flags, the cohort information is included in the `rules` property of a flag's response. You can update cohorts by updating `rules`. Default cohort information is included in the `fallthrough` property of a flag's response. You can update the default cohort by updating `fallthrough`.\nWhen you update the rollout for a cohort or the default cohort through the API, provide a rollout instead of a single `variationId`.\nTo learn more, read [Migration Flags](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flag-types/migration-flags).\n",

To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating expiring user targets.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring user targets</strong></summary>\n\n#### addExpireUserTargetDate\n\nAdds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag\n* `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual targeting\n\n#### updateExpireUserTargetDate\n\nUpdates the date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag\n* `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual targeting\n* `version`: (Optional) The version of the expiring user target to update. If included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of the expiring user target.\n\n#### removeExpireUserTargetDate\n\nRemoves the scheduled removal of the user from the flag's individual targeting. The user will remain part of the flag's individual targeting until you explicitly remove them, or until you schedule another removal.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag\n* `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual targeting\n\n</details>\n",

        "description": "Update a flag trigger. Updating a flag trigger uses the semantic patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating flag triggers.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating flag triggers</strong></summary>\n\n#### replaceTriggerActionInstructions\n\nRemoves the existing trigger action and replaces it with the new instructions.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: An array of the new `kind`s of actions to perform when triggering. Supported flag actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.\n\nHere's an example that replaces the existing action with new instructions to turn flag targeting off:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [\n    {\n      \"kind\": \"replaceTriggerActionInstructions\",\n      \"value\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\"} ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### cycleTriggerUrl\n\nGenerates a new URL for this trigger. You must update any clients using the trigger to use this new URL.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"cycleTriggerUrl\" }]\n}\n```\n\n#### disableTrigger\n\nDisables the trigger. This saves the trigger configuration, but the trigger stops running. To re-enable, use `enableTrigger`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"disableTrigger\" }]\n}\n```\n\n#### enableTrigger\n\nEnables the trigger. If you previously disabled the trigger, it begins running again.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"enableTrigger\" }]\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n",

When you create a persistent store integration, the fields in the `config` object in the request vary depending on which persistent store you use.\n\nIf you are using Redis to create your persistent store integration, you will need to know:\n\n* Your Redis host\n* Your Redis port\n* Your Redis username\n* Your Redis password\n* Whether or not LaunchDarkly should connect using TLS\n\nIf you are using DynamoDB to create your persistent store integration, you will need to know:\n\n* Your DynamoDB table name. The table must have the following schema:\n  * Partition key: `namespace` (string)\n  * Sort key: `key` (string)\n* Your DynamoDB Amazon Web Services (AWS) region.\n* Your AWS role Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This is the role that LaunchDarkly will assume to manage your DynamoDB table.\n* The External ID you specified when creating your Amazon Resource Name (ARN).\n\nTo learn more, read [Segment configuration](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/segments/big-segment-configuration).\n",

Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.\n\n### Filtering members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:\n\n- `query` is a string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `role` is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. It filters the list to members who have any of the roles in the list. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.\n- `team` is a string that matches against the key of the teams the members belong to. It is not case sensitive.\n- `noteam` is a boolean that filters the list of members who are not on a team if true and members on a team if false.\n- `lastSeen` is a JSON object in one of the following formats:\n  - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.\n  - `{\"noData\": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.\n  - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.\n- `accessCheck` is a string that represents a specific action on a specific resource and is in the format `<ActionSpecifier>:<ResourceSpecifier>`. It filters the list to members who have the ability to perform that action on that resource. Note: `accessCheck` is only supported in API version `20220603` and earlier. To learn more, read [Versioning](https://apidocs.launchdarkly.com/#section/Overview/Versioning).\n  - For example, the filter `accessCheck:createApprovalRequest:proj/default:env/test:flag/alternate-page` matches members with the ability to create an approval request for the `alternate-page` flag in the `test` environment of the `default` project.\n  - Wildcard and tag filters are not supported when filtering for access.\n\nFor example, the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole` matches members with the string `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case, who also are either an `Owner` or `Admin` or have the custom role `customrole`.\n\n### Sorting members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName` and `lastSeen`:\n\n- `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the member's email if no name is set.\n- `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen` property. LaunchDarkly considers members that have never been seen or have no data the oldest.\n",

        "description": "> ### Full use of this API resource is an Enterprise feature\n>\n> The ability to perform a partial update to multiple members is available to customers on an Enterprise plan. If you are on a Pro plan, you can update members individually. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).\n\nPerform a partial update to multiple members. Updating members uses the semantic patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating members.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating members</strong></summary>\n\n#### replaceMembersRoles\n\nReplaces the roles of the specified members. This also removes all custom roles assigned to the specified members.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new role. Must be a valid built-in role. To learn more about built-in roles, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/members/built-in-roles).\n- `memberIDs`: List of member IDs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"replaceMemberRoles\",\n    \"value\": \"reader\",\n    \"memberIDs\": [\n      \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\",\n      \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\"\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### replaceAllMembersRoles\n\nReplaces the roles of all members. This also removes all custom roles assigned to the specified members.\n\nMembers that match any of the filters are **excluded** from the update.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new role. Must be a valid built-in role. To learn more about built-in roles, read [LaunchDarkly's built-in roles](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/members/built-in-roles).\n- `filterLastSeen`: (Optional) A JSON object with one of the following formats:\n  - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.\n  - `{\"noData\": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.\n  - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.\n- `filterQuery`: (Optional) A string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `filterRoles`: (Optional) A `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.\n- `filterTeamKey`: (Optional) A string that matches against the key of the team the members belong to. It is not case sensitive.\n- `ignoredMemberIDs`: (Optional) A list of member IDs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"replaceAllMembersRoles\",\n    \"value\": \"reader\",\n    \"filterLastSeen\": { \"never\": true }\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### replaceMembersCustomRoles\n\nReplaces the custom roles of the specified members.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of new custom roles. Must be a valid custom role key or ID.\n- `memberIDs`: List of member IDs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"replaceMembersCustomRoles\",\n    \"values\": [ \"example-custom-role\" ],\n    \"memberIDs\": [\n      \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\",\n      \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\"\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### replaceAllMembersCustomRoles\n\nReplaces the custom roles of all members.

To learn more, read [Updates](/#section/Overview/Updates).\n\nTo update fields in the account member object that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Use `/0` to add to the beginning of the array. Use `/-` to add to the end of the array. For example, to add a new custom role to a member, use the following request body:\n\n```\n  [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/customRoles/0\",\n      \"value\": \"some-role-id\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\nYou can update only an account member's role or custom role using a JSON patch. Members can update their own names and email addresses though the LaunchDarkly UI.\n\nWhen SAML SSO or SCIM is enabled for the account, account members are managed in the Identity Provider (IdP). Requests to update account members will succeed, but the IdP will override the update shortly afterwards.\n",

Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.\n\n### Filtering projects\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:\n- `query` is a string that matches against the projects' names and keys. It is not case sensitive.\n- `tags` is a `+`-separated list of project tags. It filters the list of projects that have all of the tags in the list.\n\nFor example, the filter `filter=query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches projects with the string `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\nThe documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2` must be encoded to `%2B`.\n\n### Sorting projects\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting:\n- `name` sorts by project name.\n- `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the project.\n\nFor example, `sort=name` sorts the response by project name in ascending order.\n\n### Expanding the projects response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the \"List projects\" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with the `environments` field.\n\n`Environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.\n* `environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.\n\nFor example, `expand=environments` includes the `environments` field for each project in the response.\n",

Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.\n\n### Filtering environments\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:\n- `query` is a string that matches against the environments' names and keys. It is not case sensitive.\n- `tags` is a `+`-separated list of environment tags. It filters the list of environments that have all of the tags in the list.\n\nFor example, the filter `filter=query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches environments with the string `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\nThe documented values for `filter` query parameters are prior to URL encoding. For example, the `+` in `filter=tags:tag-1+tag-2` must be encoded to `%2B`.\n\n### Sorting environments\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the following fields for sorting:\n\n- `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the environment.\n- `critical` sorts by whether the environments are marked as critical.\n- `name` sorts by environment name.\n\nFor example, `sort=name` sorts the response by environment name in ascending order.\n",

An iteration can have the status `not_started`, `running` or `stopped`.\n\nFor example, `filter=flagKey:my-flag,status:running,metricKey:page-load-ms` filters for experiments for the given flag key and the given metric key which have a currently running iteration.\n\n### Expanding the experiments response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the \"Get experiments\" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:\n\n- `previousIterations` includes all iterations prior to the current iteration. By default only the current iteration is included in the response.\n- `draftIteration` includes the iteration which has not been started yet, if any.\n- `secondaryMetrics` includes secondary metrics. By default only the primary metric is included in the response.\n- `treatments` includes all treatment and parameter details.

        "description": "Update an experiment. Updating an experiment uses the semantic patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating experiments.\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates the experiment name.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new name.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"updateName\",\n    \"value\": \"Example updated experiment name\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateDescription\n\nUpdates the experiment description.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new description.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"updateDescription\",\n    \"value\": \"Example updated description\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### startIteration\n\nStarts a new iteration for this experiment. You must [create a new iteration](/tag/Experiments-(beta)#operation/createIteration) before calling this instruction.\n\nAn iteration may not be started until it meets the following criteria:\n\n* Its associated flag is toggled on and is not archived\n* Its `randomizationUnit` is set\n* At least one of its `treatments` has a non-zero `allocationPercent`\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `changeJustification`: The reason for starting a new iteration. Required when you call `startIteration` on an already running experiment, otherwise optional.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"startIteration\",\n    \"changeJustification\": \"It's time to start a new iteration\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### stopIteration\n\nStops the current iteration for this experiment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `winningTreatmentId`: The ID of the winning treatment. Treatment IDs are returned as part of the [Get experiment](/tag/Experiments-(beta)#operation/getExperiment) response. They are the `_id` of each element in the `treatments` array.\n- `winningReason`: The reason for the winner\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"stopIteration\",\n    \"winningTreatmentId\": \"3a548ec2-72ac-4e59-8518-5c24f5609ccf\",\n    \"winningReason\": \"Example reason to stop the iteration\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### archiveExperiment\n\nArchives this experiment. Archived experiments are hidden by default in the LaunchDarkly user interface. You cannot start new iterations for archived experiments.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"archiveExperiment\" }]\n}\n```\n\n#### restoreExperiment\n\nRestores an archived experiment. After restoring an experiment, you can start new iterations for it again.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{ \"kind\": \"restoreExperiment\" }]\n}\n```\n",

This API is not designed for that use case. Any evaluations you perform with this API will not be reflected in features such as flag statuses and flag insights. Context instances evaluated by this API will not appear in the Contexts list. To learn more, read [Comparing LaunchDarkly's SDKs and REST API](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/guide/api/comparing-sdk-rest-api).\n\n### Filtering \n\nLaunchDarkly supports the `filter` query param for filtering, with the following fields:\n\n- `query` filters for a string that matches against the flags' keys and names. It is not case sensitive. For example: `filter=query equals dark-mode`.\n- `tags` filters the list to flags that have all of the tags in the list. For example: `filter=tags contains [\"beta\",\"q1\"]`.\n\nYou can also apply multiple filters at once. For example, setting `filter=query equals dark-mode, tags contains [\"beta\",\"q1\"]` matches flags which match the key or name `dark-mode` and are tagged `beta` and `q1`.\n",

        "description": "Create a workflow for a feature flag. You can create a workflow directly, or you can apply a template to create a new workflow.\n\n### Creating a workflow\n\nYou can use the create workflow endpoint to create a workflow directly by adding a `stages` array to the request body.\n\nFor each stage, define the `name`, `conditions` when the stage should be executed, and `action` that describes the stage.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand example</summary>\n\n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Progressive rollout starting in two days\",\n  \"description\": \"Turn flag targeting on and increase feature rollout in 10% increments each day\",\n  \"stages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"10% rollout on day 1\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"schedule\",\n          \"scheduleKind\": \"relative\", // or \"absolute\"\n              //  If \"scheduleKind\" is \"absolute\", set \"executionDate\";\n              // \"waitDuration\" and \"waitDurationUnit\" will be ignored\n          \"waitDuration\": 2,\n          \"waitDurationUnit\": \"calendarDay\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"ld-approval\",\n          \"notifyMemberIds\": [ \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ],\n          \"notifyTeamKeys\": [ \"team-key-123abc\" ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"action\": {\n        \"instructions\": [\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"updateFallthroughVariationOrRollout\",\n            \"rolloutWeights\": {\n              \"452f5fb5-7320-4ba3-81a1-8f4324f79d49\": 90000,\n              \"fc15f6a4-05d3-4aa4-a997-446be461345d\": 10000\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n### Creating a workflow by applying a workflow template\n\nYou can also create a workflow by applying a workflow template. If you pass a valid workflow template key as the `templateKey` query parameter with the request, the API will attempt to create a new workflow with the stages defined in the workflow template with the corresponding key.\n\n#### Applicability of stages\nTemplates are created in the context of a particular flag in a particular environment in a particular project. However, because workflows created from a template can be applied to any project, environment, and flag, some steps of the workflow may need to be updated in order to be applicable for the target resource.\n\nYou can pass a `dryRun` query parameter to tell the API to return a report of which steps of the workflow template are applicable in the target project/environment/flag, and which will need to be updated. When the `dryRun` query parameter is present the response body includes a `meta` property that holds a list of parameters that could potentially be inapplicable for the target resource. Each of these parameters will include a `valid` field. You will need to update any invalid parameters in order to create the new workflow. You can do this using the `parameters` property, which overrides the workflow template parameters.\n\n#### Overriding template parameters\nYou can use the `parameters` property in the request body to tell the API to override the specified workflow template parameters with new values that are specific to your target project/environment/flag.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand example</summary>\n\n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n\t\"name\": \"workflow created from my-template\",\n\t\"description\": \"description of my workflow\",\n\t\"parameters\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3b\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/clauses/0/values\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": [\"updated-segment\"]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3d\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/variationId\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd12\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nIf there are any steps in the template that are not applicable to the target resource, the workflow will not be created, and the `meta` property will be included in the response body detailing which parameters need to be updated.\n",

To learn more the different formats, read [Updates](/#section/Overview/Updates).\n\n### Using semantic patches on a segment\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nThe body of a semantic patch request for updating segments requires an `environmentKey` in addition to `instructions` and an optional `comment`. The body of the request takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object.\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating segments.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating segments</strong></summary>\n\n#### addIncludedTargets\n\nAdds context keys to the individual context targets included in the segment for the specified `contextKind`. Returns an error if this causes the same context key to be both included and excluded.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be added to.\n- `values`: List of keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addIncludedTargets\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"org\",\n    \"values\": [ \"org-key-123abc\", \"org-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addIncludedUsers\n\nAdds user keys to the individual user targets included in the segment. Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded. If you are working with contexts, use `addIncludedTargets` instead of this instruction.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addIncludedUsers\",\n    \"values\": [ \"user-key-123abc\", \"user-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addExcludedTargets\n\nAdds context keys to the individual context targets excluded in the segment for the specified `contextKind`. Returns an error if this causes the same context key to be both included and excluded.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be added to.\n- `values`: List of keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addExcludedTargets\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"org\",\n    \"values\": [ \"org-key-123abc\", \"org-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addExcludedUsers\n\nAdds user keys to the individual user targets excluded from the segment. Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded. If you are working with contexts, use `addExcludedTargets` instead of this instruction.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addExcludedUsers\",\n    \"values\": [ \"user-key-123abc\", \"user-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeIncludedTargets\n\nRemoves context keys from the individual context targets included in the segment for the specified `contextKind`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be removed from.\n- `values`: List of keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"removeIncludedTargets\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"org\",\n    \"values\": [ \"org-key-123abc\", \"org-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeIncludedUsers\n\nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets included in the segment. If you are working with contexts, use `removeIncludedTargets` instead of this instruction.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"removeIncludedUsers\",\n    \"values\": [ \"user-key-123abc\", \"user-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeExcludedTargets\n\nRemoves context keys from the individual context targets excluded from the segment for the specified `contextKind`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `contextKind`: The context kind the targets should be removed from.\n- `values`: List of keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"removeExcludedTargets\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"org\",\n    \"values\": [ \"org-key-123abc\", \"org-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeExcludedUsers\n\nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets excluded from the segment. If you are working with contexts, use `removeExcludedTargets` instead of this instruction.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"removeExcludedUsers\",\n    \"values\": [ \"user-key-123abc\", \"user-key-456def\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates the name of the segment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Name of the segment.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"updateName\",\n    \"value\": \"Updated segment name\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Using JSON patches on a segment\n\nIf you do not include the header described above, you can use a [JSON patch](/reference#updates-using-json-patch) or [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) representation of the desired changes.\n\nFor example, to update the description for a segment with a JSON patch, use the following request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"replace\",\n      \"path\": \"/description\",\n      \"value\": \"new description\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo update fields in the segment that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/<array index>`. Use `/0` to add the new entry to the beginning of the array. Use `/-` to add the new entry to the end of the array.\n\nFor example, to add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"patch\":[\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/rules/0\",\n      \"value\": {\n        \"clauses\": [{ \"contextKind\": \"user\", \"attribute\": \"email\", \"op\": \"endsWith\", \"values\": [\".edu\"], \"negate\": false }]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo add or remove targets from segments, we recommend using semantic patch. Semantic patch for segments includes specific instructions for adding and removing both included and excluded targets.\n",

To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nIf the request is well-formed but any of its instructions failed to process, this operation returns status code `200`. In this case, the response `errors` array will be non-empty.\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating expiring context targets.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring context targets</strong></summary>\n\n#### addExpiringTarget\n\nSchedules a date and time when LaunchDarkly will remove a context from segment targeting. The segment must already have the context as an individual target.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `targetType`: The type of individual target for this context. Must be either `included` or `excluded`.\n- `contextKey`: The context key.\n- `contextKind`: The kind of context being targeted.\n- `value`: The date when the context should expire from the segment targeting, in Unix milliseconds.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addExpiringTarget\",\n    \"targetType\": \"included\",\n    \"contextKey\": \"user-key-123abc\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"user\",\n    \"value\": 1754092860000\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateExpiringTarget\n\nUpdates the date and time when LaunchDarkly will remove a context from segment targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `targetType`: The type of individual target for this context. Must be either `included` or `excluded`.\n- `contextKey`: The context key.\n- `contextKind`: The kind of context being targeted.\n- `value`: The new date when the context should expire from the segment targeting, in Unix milliseconds.\n- `version`: (Optional) The version of the expiring target to update. If included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of the expiring target.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"updateExpiringTarget\",\n    \"targetType\": \"included\",\n    \"contextKey\": \"user-key-123abc\",\n    \"contextKind\": \"user\",\n    \"value\": 1754179260000\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeExpiringTarget\n\nRemoves the scheduled expiration for the context in the segment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `targetType`: The type of individual target for this context.

For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.\n\n### Filtering teams\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:\n\n- `query` is a string that matches against the teams' names and keys. It is not case-sensitive.\n  - A request with `query:abc` returns teams with the string `abc` in their name or key.\n- `nomembers` is a boolean that filters the list of teams who have 0 members\n  - A request with `nomembers:true` returns teams that have 0 members\n  - A request with `nomembers:false` returns teams that have 1 or more members\n\n### Expanding the teams response\nLaunchDarkly supports expanding several fields in the \"List teams\" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:\n\n* `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.\n* `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.\n\nFor example, `expand=members,maintainers` includes the `members` and `maintainers` fields in the response.\n",

The app will no longer grant these custom roles to the team members.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of custom role keys.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"removeCustomRoles\",\n    \"values\": [ \"example-custom-role\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addMembers\n\nAdds members to the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of member IDs to add.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addMembers\",\n    \"values\": [ \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\", \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removeMembers\n\nRemoves members from the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of member IDs to remove.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"removeMembers\",\n    \"values\": [ \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\", \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### replaceMembers\n\nReplaces the existing members of the team with the new members.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of member IDs of the new members.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"replaceMembers\",\n    \"values\": [ \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\", \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### addPermissionGrants\n\nAdds permission grants to members for the team. For example, a permission grant could allow a member to act as a team maintainer. A permission grant may have either an `actionSet` or a list of `actions` but not both at the same time. The members do not have to be team members to have a permission grant for the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `actionSet`: Name of the action set.\n- `actions`: List of actions.\n- `memberIDs`: List of member IDs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"addPermissionGrants\",\n    \"actions\": [ \"updateTeamName\", \"updateTeamDescription\" ],\n    \"memberIDs\": [ \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\", \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### removePermissionGrants\n\nRemoves permission grants from members for the team. A permission grant may have either an `actionSet` or a list of `actions` but not both at the same time. The `actionSet` and `actions` must match an existing permission grant.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `actionSet`: Name of the action set.\n- `actions`: List of actions.\n- `memberIDs`: List of member IDs.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"removePermissionGrants\",\n    \"actions\": [ \"updateTeamName\", \"updateTeamDescription\" ],\n    \"memberIDs\": [ \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\", \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateDescription\n\nUpdates the description of the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new description.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"updateDescription\",\n    \"value\": \"Updated team description\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates the name of the team.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: The new name.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"instructions\": [{\n    \"kind\": \"updateName\",\n    \"value\": \"Updated team name\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Expanding the teams response\nLaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the \"Update team\" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:\n\n* `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.\n* `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to the team.\n* `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has any write access to.\n* `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.\n\nFor example, `expand=members,roles` includes the `members` and `roles` fields in the response.\n",

You can include data in additional columns, but LaunchDarkly ignores all data outside the first column. Headers are optional. To learn more, read [Managing team members](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/teams/managing#managing-team-members).\n\n**Members are only added on a `201` response.** A `207` indicates the CSV file contains a combination of valid and invalid entries. A `207` results in no members being added to the team.\n\nOn a `207` response, if an entry contains bad input, the `message` field contains the row number as well as the reason for the error. The `message` field is omitted if the entry is valid.\n\nExample `207` response:\n```json\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"value\": \"new-team-member@acme.com\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Line 2: empty row\",\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"value\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Line 3: email already exists in the specified team\",\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"value\": \"existing-team-member@acme.com\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Line 4: invalid email formatting\",\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"value\": \"invalid email format\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nMessage | Resolution\n--- | ---\nEmpty row | This line is blank.

Remove the email from the file and try again.\nEmail already exists in the specified team | This member is already on your team.

Fix the formatting and try again.\nEmail does not belong to a LaunchDarkly member | The email address doesn't belong to a LaunchDarkly account member. Invite them to LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team.\n\nOn a `400` response, the `message` field may contain errors specific to this endpoint.\n\nExample `400` response:\n```json\n{\n  \"code\": \"invalid_request\",\n  \"message\": \"Unable to process file\"\n}\n```\n\nMessage | Resolution\n--- | ---\nUnable to process file | LaunchDarkly could not process the file for an unspecified reason. Review your file for errors and try again.\nFile exceeds 25mb | Break up your file into multiple files of less than 25mbs each.\nAll emails have invalid formatting | None of the email addresses in the file are in the correct format. Fix the formatting and try again.\nAll emails belong to existing team members | All listed members are already on this team. Populate the file with member emails that do not belong to the team and try again.\nFile is empty | The CSV file does not contain any email addresses. Populate the file and try again.\nNo emails belong to members of your LaunchDarkly organization | None of the email addresses belong to members of your LaunchDarkly account.

The user must already be individually targeted for each flag.\n\nYou can add, update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only schedule a user for removal on a single variation per flag.\n\nUpdating an expiring target uses the semantic patch format. To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating expiring user targets.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating expiring user targets</strong></summary>\n\n#### addExpireUserTargetDate\n\nAdds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `flagKey`: The flag key\n* `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag\n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag.\n\n#### updateExpireUserTargetDate\n\nUpdates the date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `flagKey`: The flag key\n* `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag\n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag.\n* `version`: The version of the expiring user target to update. If included, update will fail if version doesn't match current version of the expiring user target.\n\n#### removeExpireUserTargetDate\n\nRemoves the scheduled removal of the user from the flag's individual targeting. The user will remain part of the flag's individual targeting until explicitly removed, or until another removal is scheduled.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `flagKey`: The flag key\n* `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag\n\n</details>\n",
